A Tour & Travel Website made using Node.js, Express, Passport.js (authentication), MongoDB, Nodemailer (for sending email to a user)

The application is composed of the following Features:

### Front-End
* A landing page with animated minimalistic design, with the tagline of our Website.
* Tours Page containing a map consisting of geographical location of all tours, search bar to search a particular tour & list of 4 tours on a single page.
* A page with Sign-in and Sign-out components.
* An individual tour page containing reviews & information of a particular tour. 
* A review Page to rate & give a review to a particular tour.


### Backend
* As of this moment I am using Mongodb for storing all data & passport.js for user authentication.
* It is also used to store user data 
* I am using REST APIs for routing between different pages.
* Any user can perform CRUD operations.
* Also, there is an admin role with certain privileges.
